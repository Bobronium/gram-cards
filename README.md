# Gram Cards

Cards that will make you a better developer.

Gram cards is a collection of smart phrases from smart people about software engineering. Print, cut, shuffle, put them on your table, and take random cards daily as a reminder. Software engineering is a mess, but it shouldn't be. Make the world a better place.

All pages are A4 SVG images generated with [svg.py](https://github.com/orsinium-labs/svg.py). So, you can scale and modify them as you want. And if you have a laser cutter, you can also automate cutting them out.
