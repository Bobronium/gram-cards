Nothing is some else's problem
Keep it simple
Automate everything
Decouple and isolate
The project must always work
Welcome changing requirements
Never ship shit
The software must be changeable
Keep interfaces small
The code must improve over time
QA must find nothing
Refactoring must be safe and easy
Ask as much as you can
Say "No" if the answer is "No"
Use TDD
Allow major decisions to be deferred
No global state
Do not break interfaces
Prove it
Have sleep
Don't work overtime
Review is a way to improve
